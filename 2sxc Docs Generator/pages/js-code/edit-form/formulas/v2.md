# Formulas JavaScript V2 Specs 🆕 v16

V2 formulas are a major enhancement to [v1](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.V1) formulas.
Improvements include:

1. **Intellisense** while typing the formula using VS Code

1. **Promise** support

1. Ability to **stop** the formula from running

1. Ability to **set other fields** from a formula

1. Ability to add **Comments** before the formula

1. Ability to get **App Settings** in your formula

1. Ability to return **Validation** on a field

## V2 Function Specs

```js
// new formula syntax - see https://go.2sxc.org/formulas
v2((data, context) => {
  return data.value;
});
```

1. All functions must be called `v2`, it must be lower case  
   This is important because when APIs change, we will use v3, etc.

1. The first line in the code must start with the function name `v2`.  
    You _can_ put comments or empty lines before the `v2`, but they must always use `//` and not `/* */`

1. The `v2(...)` function takes 1 parameter, namely the function to execute. This is different from v1.

1. The reason we need an inner function is so that VS Code can provide intellisense while you type.

1. Your function _must_ look like one of these
    * `v2(() => { ... });`
    * `v2((data) => { ... });`
    * `v2((data, context) => { ... });`

1. The parameter names are anything you want, but the order of what you get is always `data` and then `context`. You can also write
    * `v2((d, c) => { ... });`


## The `data` and `context` Objects

## Return Values on v2

You can return the same data as you did in v1 but we now have more options:

1. return the value which should be used, like `return true;` or `return data.value;` (same as v1)

1. return a special `FormulaResult`-object (specs below) like `return { value: true, stop: true };`

1. return a promise which will resolve to one of the above

1. return a special validation object (specs below)

For the next part of the documentation, we'll refer to the value to be used as the **Value** and if a special object is returned, we'll call it the **FormulaResult**.

TODO: Validation

## The FormulaResult Object

For advanced features, the formula must be able to return multiple values, which is why we have the **FormulaResult** object.
It has the following properties - all of which are _optional_:

* `value` - the value to be used as the result of the formula
* `stop` - if true, the formula will stop and not execute any other formulas
* `promise` - a promise to run - eg. in scenarios where we returned a value for now, and a promise for later
* `fields` - an array of fields to be set, each with a `name` and `value` property


## The Returned Value

The returned value is either a simple value returned directly using `return '...';` or the `value` property of the **FormulaResult** object.

Each field type or property may expect a different data type. Make sure you provide that.
So if you are updating a boolean field, you should return a boolean value.

> [!WARNING]
> If you return nothing, `undefined` or the wrong data type, the result will be ignored and the value/setting will not be changed.

Common Mistakes

* returning nothing with `return;` - this will be regarded as an error and be ignored.
* returning `undefined`.
* Returning a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) instead of a real `true` or `false` for a boolean value
* returning a date with the wrong timezone - see [returning dates](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.ReturnDate)


## Returning a Promise

This is a highlight in v2.
Any formula can now return a promise, or a **FormulaResult** object with a `promise` property.

The promise itself can then return a value or a **FormulaResult** object.

> [!TIP]
> When a promise is returned, it behaves as if `stop` was set to true.
> So returned promises deactivate the formula to not run again.
>
> If your code is more sophisticated and needs to run again,
> then the promise should also return something like `{ value: 'new value', stop: false }`.


## Returning Validation Information

Field Validations are errors/warnings about the contents of the field.
The purpose is to do very special validations,
or to show a warning for values which could be ok, but are not recommended.

A validation object return looks like this:

```js
{
  severity: 'warning',
  message: 'please use lower case only',
}
```

Since the this kind of _return value_ is an object, in can easily be confused with a **FormulaResult** object.
So to return this object, it _must_ be wrapped in a **FormulaResult** object like this:

```js
return {
  value: {
    severity: 'warning',
    message: 'please use lower case only',
  }
};
```

You can see an example of this in the [tutorial](https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/en/razor/f115/page).






## Tips and Tricks

1. You can always add a `console.log(data, context);` or similar in your code to see in real time what's being processed.
1. You can also add a line `debugger;` and the browser will stop at this line so you can inspect the variables and watch your code.
1. For now, we strongly recommend to use Formulas as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), but with experience the recommendation may change.
